There are three ways to wrap a TI method:

- [**Directly through R**](create_ti_method_r): Using R packages as dependencies, and using R to read in the data, infer the trajectory and return a trajectory model. This has the least overhead, although you're restricted to R.
- [**Using a wrapper script**](create_ti_method_script): A wrapper script in python/R/... that will read the data, infer the trajectory and save the output
- [**Using a container**](create_ti_method_container): A container in which any dependencies are installed, and which calls a wrapper script internally. This has the largest learning curve, but is the easiest to use on different execution environments and the easiest to distribute to users.
