# Method users

The **dyno** package offers **end-users** a complete TI pipeline. It features:

* a uniform interface to 50+ [TI methods](https://github.com/dynverse/dynmethods#list-of-included-methods),
* an [interactive guideline tool](https://github.com/dynverse/dyno#selecting-the-most-optimal-ti-methods) to help the user select the most appropriate method, 
* [streamlined interpretation and visualisation of trajectories](https://github.com/dynverse/dyno#plotting-the-trajectory), including colouring by gene expression or clusters, and
* downstream analyses such as the [identification of potential marker genes](https://github.com/dynverse/dyno#predicting-and-visualising-genes-of-interest).

Note that dyno is currently still under development.
